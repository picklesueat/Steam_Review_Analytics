# Analytics experience

Use this directory to store BI artifacts (Hex notebooks, Mode reports, Looker explores) that leverage the gold marts and semantic metrics. Include:

* Query definitions or exports (e.g., `.sql`, `.json`).
* Dashboard documentation explaining intended audience and KPIs.
* Screenshots (checked into `docs/`) showcasing Breadth vs Intensity quadrant explorer and hold-up analyses.

Maintain alignment with the semantic layer by referencing metric names defined in dbt. Avoid hard-coded business logic in notebooks wherever possible.
